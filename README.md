The package can be downloaded directly from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Wpf) or by using the Package Manager Console:

    PM> Install-Package KGySoft.Drawing.Wpf

#### [KGySoft.Drawing.Uwp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Uwp) [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/KGySoft.Drawing.Uwp.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Uwp)

This package helps accessing the bitmap data of the `WriteableBitmap` type in UWP (Universal Windows Platform). This library requires targeting at least Windows 10.0.16299.0 (Fall Creators Update, version 1709) so it can reference the .NET Standard 2.0 version of the dependent core libraries.

The package can be downloaded directly from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Uwp) or by using the Package Manager Console:

    PM> Install-Package KGySoft.Drawing.Uwp

#### [KGySoft.Drawing.WinUI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.WinUI) [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/KGySoft.Drawing.WinUI.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.WinUI)

This package helps accessing the bitmap data of the `WriteableBitmap` type of the Windows App SDK used in WinUI applications. This library requires targeting at least .NET 5 and Windows 10.0.17763.0 (October 2018 release, version 1809).

The package can be downloaded directly from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.WinUI) or by using the Package Manager Console:

    PM> Install-Package KGySoft.Drawing.WinUI

#### [KGySoft.Drawing.SkiaSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.SkiaSharp) [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/KGySoft.Drawing.SkiaSharp.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.SkiaSharp)

This package provides dedicated support for the `SKBitmap`, `SKPixmap`, `SKImage` and `SKSurface` types of SkiaSharp. All pixel formats are supported (and [unlike](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/2354) SkiaSharp's own `GetPixel`, `IReadableBitmapData.GetPixel` also works correctly for all pixel formats), though for the fastest direct support the color space should be either sRGB or linear. The library also offers direct [pixel format conversion](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_SkiaSharp_SKBitmapExtensions_ConvertPixelFormat.htm) with optional quantizing and dithering.

The package can be downloaded directly from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.SkiaSharp) or by using the Package Manager Console:

## Examples

### Icon Manipulation
<sub>(Requires the [KGySoft.Drawing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing) package for the GDI+ `Icon` type)</sub>

Icon images of different resolutions and color depth can be extracted from an `Icon`, whereas `Bitmap` and `Icon` instances can be combined into a new `Icon`. PNG compressed icons are also supported.

```cs
// extracting the 256x256 image from an icon:
Bitmap bmp = Icons.Information.ExtractBitmap(new Size(256, 256));

// combining an existing icon with a bitmap:
Icon combined = myIcon.Combine(bmp);
```

> 💡 _Tip:_ See more details at the [Icons](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Icons.htm) and [IconExtensions](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_IconExtensions.htm) classes.

### Fast Bitmap Manipulation
<sub>(This example requires the [KGySoft.Drawing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing) package for the GDI+ `Bitmap` type but works similarly also for any other bitmaps you can create an [`IBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IBitmapData.htm) instance for.)</sub>

As it is well known, `Bitmap.SetPixel`/`GetPixel` methods are very slow, and `Bitmap.SetPixel` does not even support every pixel format. A typical solution can be to obtain a `BitmapData` by the `LockBits` method, which has further drawbacks: you need to use unsafe code and pointers, and the way you need to access the bitmap data depends on the actual `PixelFormat` of the bitmap.

KGy SOFT Drawing Libraries offer a very fast and convenient way to overcome these issues. A managed accessor can be obtained by the [`GetReadableBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_BitmapExtensions_GetReadableBitmapData.htm), [`GetWritableBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_BitmapExtensions_GetWritableBitmapData.htm) and [`GetReadWriteBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_BitmapExtensions_GetReadWriteBitmapData.htm) methods:

```cs
var targetFormat = PixelFormat.Format8bppIndexed; // feel free to try other formats as well
using (Bitmap bmpSrc = Icons.Shield.ExtractBitmap(new Size(256, 256)))
using (Bitmap bmpDst = new Bitmap(256, 256, targetFormat))
{
    using (IReadableBitmapData dataSrc = bmpSrc.GetReadableBitmapData())
    using (IWritableBitmapData dataDst = bmpDst.GetWritableBitmapData())
    {
        IReadableBitmapDataRow rowSrc = dataSrc.FirstRow;
        IWritableBitmapDataRow rowDst = dataDst.FirstRow;
        do
        {
            for (int x = 0; x < dataSrc.Width; x++)
                rowDst[x] = rowSrc[x]; // works also between different pixel formats

        } while (rowSrc.MoveNextRow() && rowDst.MoveNextRow());
    }

    bmpSrc.SaveAsPng(@"c:\temp\bmpSrc.png");
    bmpDst.SaveAsPng(@"c:\temp\bmpDst.png"); // or saveAsGif/SaveAsTiff to preserve the indexed format
}
```

> 💡 _Tip:_ See more examples with images at the [`GetReadWriteBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_BitmapExtensions_GetReadWriteBitmapData.htm) extension method.

If you know the actual pixel format you can also access the raw data in a managed way. See the [`IReadableBitmapDataRow.ReadRaw`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IReadableBitmapDataRow_ReadRaw__1.htm) and [`IWritableBitmapDataRow.WriteRaw`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IWritableBitmapDataRow_WriteRaw__1.htm) methods for details and examples.

### Fast GetPixel/SetPixel For Any Bitmaps

The previous example showed how to obtain an [`IReadWriteBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IReadWriteBitmapData.htm) for a GDI+ `Bitmap`. But by using the different specific [available packages](#available-packages) the corresponding `GetReadWriteBitmapData` method will be available also for other bitmap types such as `SKBitmap` of [SkiaSharp](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_SkiaSharp_SKBitmapExtensions_GetReadWriteBitmapData.htm), or the `WriteableBitmap` type of [WPF](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_Wpf_WriteableBitmapExtensions_GetReadWriteBitmapData.htm), UWP or [WinUI](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_WinUI_WriteableBitmapExtensions_GetReadWriteBitmapData.htm) platforms offering fast [`GetPixel`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IReadableBitmapData_GetPixel.htm) and [`SetPixel`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IWritableBitmapData_SetPixel.htm) methods that are normally not available for a `WiteableBitmap` at all.

### Managed Bitmap Data Manipulation
<sub>(These examples require the [KGySoft.Drawing.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Core) package.)</sub>

Not only for the well-known `Bitmap`, `WriteableBitmap` or `SKBitmap` types can you obtain a managed accessor (as described above) but you can also create a completely managed bitmap data instance by the [`BitmapDataFactory`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataFactory.htm) class. See the [`BitmapDataExtensions`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataExtensions.htm) for the available operations on a bitmap data:

```cs
// Creating a completely managed, platform independent bitmap data.
// This overload allocates an internal managed storage.
using var managedBitmapData = BitmapDataFactory.CreateBitmapData(
    new Size(256, 128), KnownPixelFormat.Format32bppArgb);
```

#### Self-allocating vs. Preallocated Buffers

The [`BitmapDataFactory`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataFactory.htm) class has many [`CreateBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/Overload_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataFactory_CreateBitmapData.htm) overloads. The ones whose first parameter is `Size` allocate the underlying buffer by themselves, which is not directly accessible from outside. But you are also able to use predefined arrays of any primitive element type (one or two dimensional ones), and also [`ArraySection<T>`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/corelibraries/html/T_KGySoft_Collections_ArraySection_1.htm) or [`Array2D<T>`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/corelibraries/html/T_KGySoft_Collections_Array2D_1.htm) buffers to create a managed bitmap data for:

```cs
// interpreting a byte array as 8 bpp grayscale pixels
public static IReadWriteBitmapData GetBitmapData(byte[] pixelBuffer, int width, int height)
{
     // As the result is interpreted as a grayscale image, writing operations
     // such as SetPixel will automatically adjust the colors to a grayscale value
     return BitmapDataFactory.CreateBitmapData(pixelBuffer, new Size(width, height),
         stride: width, // Row size in bytes. For 8 bpp pixels it can be the same as width.
         pixelFormat: KnownPixelFormat.Format8bppIndexed, // Indexed: pixels are palette entries
         palette: Palette.Grayscale256()); // Using a palette of 256 grayscale entries
}
```

### 3rd Party Bitmap Types Support
<sup>(This example requires the [KGySoft.Drawing.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Core) package and WPF. Actually you can simply use the [KGySoft.Drawing.Wpf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Wpf) package for WPF.)</sup>

The [`BitmapDataFactory`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataFactory.htm) class has also [`CreateBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/Overload_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataFactory_CreateBitmapData.htm) overloads to support unmanaged memory. This makes possible to support any bitmap representation that exposes its buffer by a pointer.

For example, this is how you can create a managed accessor for a `WriteableBitmap` instance commonly used in WPF/WinRT/UWP and other XAML-based environments, which expose such a pointer or stream:

> 💡 _Tip:_ In fact, if you use the `WriteableBitmap` of WPF/UWP/WinUI platforms, then you can simply use the [`GetReadWriteBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_Wpf_WriteableBitmapExtensions_GetReadWriteBitmapData.htm) extensions from their corresponding [package](#available-packages). But this is how you can turn a bitmap of any environment into a managed bitmap data that does not have direct support yet.

```cs
// Though naming is different, PixelFormats.Pbgra32 is the same as KnownPixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb.
var bitmap = new WriteableBitmap(width, height, dpiX, dpiY, PixelFormats.Pbgra32, null);

// creating the managed bitmap data for WriteableBitmap:
using (var bitmapData = BitmapDataFactory.CreateBitmapData(
    bitmap.BackBuffer,
    new Size(bitmap.PixelWidth, bitmap.PixelHeight),
    bitmap.BackBufferStride,
    KnownPixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb)
{
    // Do whatever with bitmapData
}

// Actualizing changes. But see also the next example to see how to do these along with disposing.
bitmap.AddDirtyRect(new Int32Rect(0, 0, bitmap.PixelWidth, bitmap.PixelHeight));
bitmap.Unlock();
```

### Supporting Custom Pixel Formats
<sup>(This example requires the [KGySoft.Drawing.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Core) package and WPF. Actually you can simply use the [KGySoft.Drawing.Wpf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Wpf) package for WPF.)</sup>

The previous example demonstrated how we can create a managed accessor for a `WriteableBitmap`. But it worked only because we used a pixel format that happens to have built-in support also in KGy SOFT Drawing Libraries. In fact, the libraries provide support for any custom pixel format. The [`CreateBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/Overload_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataFactory_CreateBitmapData.htm) methods have several overloads that allow you to specify a custom pixel format along with a couple of delegates to be called when pixels are read or written:

```cs
// Though Gray8 format also has built-in support in KGySoft.Drawing.Core
// (see KnownPixelFormat.Format8bppGrayScale) here we pretend as if it was not supported natively.
// So this is our bitmap with the custom pixel format:
var bitmap = new WriteableBitmap(width, height, dpiX, dpiY, PixelFormats.Gray8, null);

// We need to specify a configuration that tells some info about the pixel format
// and how pixels can be got/set from known color formats.
var customConfig = new CustomBitmapDataConfig
{
    PixelFormat = new PixelFormatInfo { BitsPerPixel = 8, Grayscale = true },
    BackBufferIndependentPixelAccess = true,
    BackColor = Color.Silver.ToColor32(), // black if not specified

    // In this example we specify Color32 access but you can use other color types
    // if they fit better for the format (eg. Color64, ColorF or their premultiplied counterparts).
    // Note that the setter blends possible alpha colors with the back color.
    RowGetColor32 = (row, x) => Color32.FromGray(row.UnsafeGetRefAs<byte>(x)),
    RowSetColor32 = (row, x, c) => row.UnsafeGetRefAs<byte>(x) =
        c.Blend(row.BitmapData.BackColor, row.BitmapData.WorkingColorSpace).GetBrightness(),

    // Now we specify also a dispose callback to be executed when the returned instance is disposed:
    DisposeCallback = () =>
    {
        bitmap.AddDirtyRect(new Int32Rect(0, 0, bitmap.PixelWidth, bitmap.PixelHeight));
        bitmap.Unlock();
    }
};

// Returning an IReadWriteBitmapData instance that wraps our native bitmap with the custom format:
return BitmapDataFactory.CreateBitmapData(
    bitmap.BackBuffer, new Size(bitmap.PixelWidth, bitmap.PixelHeight), bitmap.BackBufferStride,
    customConfig); 
```

> 💡 _Tip:_ See also the [Xamarin](Examples/Xamarin) and [MAUI](Examples/Maui) examples that demonstrate [how](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/8ac1a38317660a954ac6cf416c55d1fc3108c2fc/Examples/Maui/Extensions/SKBitmapExtensions.cs#L85) to create a bitmap data for SkiaSharp's `SKBitmap` type as if there was no dedicated package for SkiaSharp.

Note that there are different overloads for indexed formats where you have to specify how to read/write a palette index. Please also note that these delegates work with 32-bit color structures (just like usual `GetPixel`/`SetPixel`) so wider formats will be quantized into the ARGB8888 color space (or BGRA8888, using the alternative terminology) when getting/setting pixels but this is how regular formats work, too. Anyway, you can always access the actual underlying data of whatever format by the aforementioned [`IReadableBitmapDataRow.ReadRaw`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IReadableBitmapDataRow_ReadRaw__1.htm) and [`IWritableBitmapDataRow.WriteRaw`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IWritableBitmapDataRow_WriteRaw__1.htm) methods.

### Color Correct Alpha Blending

Most pixel formats use the sRGB color space, in which alpha blending (and also other operations) may provide incorrect results.

|Description|Image Example|
|--|--|
| Result of blending colors in the sRGB color space. The vertical bars are opaque, whereas the horizontal ones have 50% transparency. Blending colors with disjunct RGB components often produce too dark results. | ![Blending colored stripes in the sRGB color space](Help/Images/BlendingExampleSrgb.png) |
| Result of blending colors in the linear color space. The result seems much more natural. Note that horizontal bars still have 50% transparency, though they seem brighter now. | ![Blending colored stripes in the linear color space](Help/Images/BlendingExampleLinear.png) |

By default it depends on the used pixel format which color space is used in KGy SOFT Drawing Libraries. The default pixel format in most rendering engines use some sRGB format (usually a premultiplied one), which is optimized for blending in the sRGB color space. When creating a managed bitmap data by the [`CreateBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/Overload_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataFactory_CreateBitmapData.htm) overloads or by the `GetReadable/Writable/ReadWriteBitmapData` methods of the specific libraries you can use the overloads that have a [`WorkingColorSpace`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_WorkingColorSpace.htm) parameter.

> 💡 _Tip:_ See the [`WorkingColorSpace`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_WorkingColorSpace.htm) enumeration for more information and image examples about working in the sRGB and linear color spaces.

### Quantizing and Dithering

KGy SOFT Drawing Libraries offer quantizing (reducing the number of colors of an image) and dithering (techniques for preserving the details of a quantized image) in several ways:

* The [`ImageExtensions.ConvertPixelFormat`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_ImageExtensions_ConvertPixelFormat.htm)/[`BitmapDataExtensions.Clone`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataExtensions_Clone_3.htm) extension methods return new `Bitmap`/[`IReadWriteBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IReadWriteBitmapData.htm) instances as the result of the quantizing/dithering.
* The [`BitmapExtensions.Quantize`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_BitmapExtensions_Quantize.htm)/[`BitmapDataExtensions.Quantize`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataExtensions_Quantize.htm) and [`BitmapExtensions.Dither`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_BitmapExtensions_Dither.htm)/[`BitmapDataExtensions.Dither`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataExtensions_Dither.htm) extension methods modify the original `Bitmap`/[`IReadWriteBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IReadWriteBitmapData.htm) instance.
* Some [`ImageExtensions.DrawInto`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/Overload_KGySoft_Drawing_ImageExtensions_DrawInto.htm)/[`BitmapDataExtensions.DrawInto`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/Overload_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataExtensions_DrawInto.htm) overloads can use quantizing and dithering when drawing different instances into each other.
* Several further extension methods in the [`BitmapExtensions`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_BitmapExtensions.htm)/[`BitmapDataExtensions`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_BitmapDataExtensions.htm) classes have an [`IDitherer`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IDitherer.htm) parameter.

> 💡 _Tip:_
> * For built-in quantizers see the [`PredefinedColorsQuantizer`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_PredefinedColorsQuantizer.htm) and [`OptimizedPaletteQuantizer`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_OptimizedPaletteQuantizer.htm) classes. See their members for code samples and image examples.
> * For built-in ditherers see the [`OrderedDitherer`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_OrderedDitherer.htm), [`ErrorDiffusionDitherer`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_ErrorDiffusionDitherer.htm), [`RandomNoiseDitherer`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_RandomNoiseDitherer.htm) and [`InterleavedGradientNoiseDitherer`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_InterleavedGradientNoiseDitherer.htm) classes. See their members for code samples and image examples.

### Advanced GIF Encoder with High Color Support

The KGy SOFT Drawing Libraries make possible creating high quality GIF images and animations:
* For `Image` types the simplest and highest-level access is provided by the [`ImageExtension`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_ImageExtensions.htm) class and its `SaveAs*` methods.
* Alternatively, you can use the static methods of the [`GifEncoder`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_GifEncoder.htm) class to create animations or even high color still images. See also the [`AnimatedGifConfiguration`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_AnimatedGifConfiguration.htm) class.
* To create a GIF image or animation completely manually you can instantiate the [`GifEncoder`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_GifEncoder.htm) class that provides you the lowest-level access.

#### Examples:

|Description|Image Example|
|--|--|
| True color GIF animation. The last frame has 29,731 colors. The Granger Rainbow has been generated from an alpha gradient bitmap by [this code](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/9157c58a24f29174e3475f89d0990a28f81691aa/KGySoft.Drawing.UnitTest/UnitTests/Imaging/GifEncoderTest.cs#L693). | ![True color GIF animation (29,731 colors)](Help/Images/GifAnimationTrueColor.gif) |
| Warning icon encoded as a high color GIF. It has only single bit transparency but otherwise its colors have been preserved. It consists of 18 layers and has 4,363 colors. | ![Warning icon as a high color GIF image](Help/Images/WarningHighColor.gif) |
| Test image "Lena" encoded as a high color GIF. Before encoding it was prequantized with [RGB565 16-bit quantizer](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_PredefinedColorsQuantizer_Rgb565.htm) using [Floyd-Steinberg dithering](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/P_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_ErrorDiffusionDitherer_FloydSteinberg.htm). It consists of 18 layers and has 4,451 colors. The file size is about 80% of the original [PNG encoded version](Help/Images/Lena.png) but could be even smaller without the dithering. | ![Test image "Lena" encoded as a high color GIF. Prequantized to the 16-bit RGB565 color space using Floyd-Steinberg dithering](Help/Images/LenaRgb565DitheredFS.gif) |

> ⚠️ _Note:_ Please note that multi layered high color GIF images might be mistakenly rendered as animations by some decoders, including browsers. Still images do not contain the Netscape application extension and do not have any delays. Such images are processed properly by GDI+ on Windows, by the `System.Drawing.Bitmap` and `Image` classes and applications relying on GDI+ decoders such as Windows Paint or [KGy SOFT Imaging Tools](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing.Tools/#kgy-soft-imaging-tools).
