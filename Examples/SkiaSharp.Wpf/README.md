# KGy SOFT Drawing SkiaSharp in WPF Example

This example demonstrates how to obtain an [`IReadWriteBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IReadWriteBitmapData.htm) instance for the `SKBitmap` class of any pixel format in a WPF application using the [`KGySoft.Drawing.SkiaSharp`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.SkiaSharp) package and perform various operations on it.

> 💡 _Tip:_ There are similar example applications for [MAUI](../Maui) and [Xamarin](../Xamarin) that also work with SkiaSharp, but they do it without using the dedicated SkiaSharp-specific package. They demonstrate how to manually obtain a bitmap data for a typical 3rd party bitmap implementation. But if you need to handle all possible color types and alpha types that an `SKBitmap` can represent, then this one is the recommended example.
