! Breaking change
* Compatible change
- Bugfix
+ New feature
===============================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~
! v10.0.1:
~~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly changes:
===================
! Targeting also .NET 8.0, which requires referencing at least SDK version 1.8, whereas the .NET 6.0 target keeps
  referencing SDK version 1.6. Normally this should not be a breaking change, but unfortunately the
  Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK package introduced a DLL hell issue in v1.8 in one of its transitive dependency, which
  prevents upgrading a WinUI application to SDK v1.8 if one of its referenced packages still depends on SDK v1.6.
  This is maybe the least painful way to allow a consumer project upgrading to v1.8+, while keeping the
  compatibility for projects that still target the already out-of-support .NET 6/7 platforms.
  See more details at https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/issues/4807#issuecomment-3730598360.

! Assembly changes:
===================
! Changing the target framework to .NET 6.0 because compiling against .NET 5.0 does not work with the latest SDKs.
* Referencing KGySoft.Drawing.Core v9.0.0, which enables high performance shape drawing. Combined with this package
  it makes possible to draw shapes into WriteableBitmap instances, even with quantizing and dithering.
