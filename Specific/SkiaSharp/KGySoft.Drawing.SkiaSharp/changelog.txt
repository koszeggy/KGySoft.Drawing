~~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly changes
==================
! Upgrading SkiaSharp package from 3.116.1 to 3.119.0. This is required to support the new Rgba10x6 color type.
! Referencing KGySoft.Drawing.Core v10.0.0. It contains some breaking changes, though none of them affects SkiaSharp
  features directly.

+ KGySoft.Drawing.SkiaSharp namespace
=====================================
+ New SkiaSharpModule class: To be able to trigger module initialization without calling any specific feature.
+ New ReadWriteBitmapDataExtensions class:
  + New DrawText[Async] methods: To draw a text using an SKFont into an IReadWriteBitmapData instance.
  + New DrawTextOutline[Async] methods: To draw the outline of a text using an SKFont into an IReadWriteBitmapData
    instance.
+ New SKPathExtensions class:
  + New ToPath method: to convert an SKPath to a KGySoft.Drawing.Shapes.Path.
  + New ToSKPath method: to convert a KGySoft.Drawing.Shapes.Path to an SKPath.
+ SKImageInfoExtensions, SKBitmapExtensions, SKPixmapExtensions, SKImageExtensions, SKSurfaceExtensions classes:
  + Supporting the new Rgba10x6 color type directly.


~~~~~~~~~
* v9.1.0:
~~~~~~~~~

* Assembly changes
==================
* Referencing KGySoft.Drawing.Core v9.1.0, which contains minor bug fixes.
  See also https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/KGySoft.Drawing.Core/changelog.txt


~~~~~~~~~
! v9.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly changes
==================
! Upgrading SkiaSharp package from 2.88.6 to 3.116.1. This is required to support the new color formats.
! Dropping support for .NET Core 2.0. Manual compilation for .NET Core 2.0 is still possible but the public NuGet
  packages are not going to support this platform anymore. If you target the .NET Core 2.0 platform in your project,
  the v9.0.0 version of the NuGet package will pick the .NET Standard 2.0 build instead.
* Referencing KGySoft.Drawing.Core v9.0.0, which enables high performance shape drawing. Combined with this package
  it makes possible to draw shapes into SKBitmap instances of any pixel format, even with quantizing and dithering.

  and also https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/README.md#shape-drawing

+ KGySoft.Drawing.SkiaSharp namespace
=====================================
+ SKImageInfoExtensions, SKBitmapExtensions, SKPixmapExtensions, SKImageExtensions, SKSurfaceExtensions classes:
  + Supporting the new Bgr101010xXR color type directly.
  + Supporting the new Srgba8888 color type directly.
  + Supporting the new R8Unorm color type directly.


~~~~~~~~~
* v8.1.0:
~~~~~~~~~

* Assembly changes
==================
* Referencing KGySoft.Drawing.Core v8.1.0, which mainly improves performance.
  See also https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/KGySoft.Drawing.Core/changelog.txt
* Upgrading SkiaSharp package to 2.88.7.


~~~~~~~~~
! v8.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly changes
==================
! Upgrading SkiaSharp package from 2.88.3 to 2.88.6. This is required due to a SkiaSharp vulnerability between
  versions 2.0.0 to 2.88.5: https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DOTNET-SKIASHARP-5922114. Marked as a breaking change
  because version 2.88.6 contains several new bugs, including some encoder issues, which cause previously correctly
  saved images to get corrupted: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues?q=label%3Atype%2Fbug+2.88.6+

! KGySoft.Drawing.SkiaSharp namespace
=====================================
! SKImageInfoExtensions class:
  ! GetInfo method: The new Prefers128BitColors or Prefers64BitColors property is now set for some pixel formats.
+ ColorExtensions class:
  + New conversion methods also for SKColorF and SKPMColor types.
  + New ToPColor32, ToColor64, ToPColor64, ToColorF and ToPColorF conversion methods for SkiaSharp color types.
+ SKBitmapExtensions class:
  + GetReadableBitmapData/GetWritableBitmapData/GetReadWriteBitmapData methods:
    + They support getting/setting pixels using wide colors without quantizing the color information to the 32-bit
      ARGB color space.
+ SKPixmapExtensions class:
  + GetReadableBitmapData/GetWritableBitmapData/GetReadWriteBitmapData methods:
    + They support getting/setting pixels using wide colors without quantizing the color information to the 32-bit
      ARGB color space.
+ SKImageExtensions class:
  + GetReadableBitmapData method overloads: They support getting/setting pixels using wide colors without quantizing
    the color information to the 32-bit ARGB color space.
+ SKSurfaceExtensions class:
  + GetReadableBitmapData/GetWritableBitmapData/GetReadWriteBitmapData methods:
    + They support getting/setting pixels using wide colors without quantizing the color information to the 32-bit
      ARGB color space.
