The KGy SOFT Drawing Libraries package offers advanced features for `System.Drawing` types such as `Bitmap`, `Metafile`, `Image`, `Icon`, `Graphics`.

> ⚠️ _Warning_: Version 7.0.0 introduced several breaking changes. Most importantly, the technology-agnostic and platform independent APIs have been extracted into a separated package: [KGySoft.Drawing.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Core/).

> 📝 _Note_: In .NET 7 and above this package can be used on Windows only. When targeting earlier versions, Unix/Linux based systems are also supported (if the libgdiplus library is installed).

Main highlights:
- Fast [direct native Bitmap data access](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_BitmapExtensions_GetReadWriteBitmapData.htm) for every PixelFormat.
- High performance [shape drawing](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/README.md#shape-drawing) even into `Bitmap` instances with indexed pixel formats.
- [Quantizing](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_BitmapExtensions_Quantize.htm) and [dithering](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_BitmapExtensions_Dither.htm).
- Creating [GIF animations](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/Overload_KGySoft_Drawing_ImageExtensions_SaveAsAnimatedGif.htm) even in high color.
- Several [built-in icons](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Icons.htm) as well as simple access to Windows associated and stock icons.
- Extracting bitmaps from multi-frame bitmaps and icons.
- Creating combined icons and multi-resolution bitmaps.
- Saving metafiles in EMF/WMF formats.
- Advanced support for saving images as Icon, BMP, JPEG, PNG, GIF and TIFF formats.
- [Converting between various pixel formats](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/M_KGySoft_Drawing_ImageExtensions_ConvertPixelFormat.htm) preserving transparency if possible.
- Useful extensions for the [Icon](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_IconExtensions.htm), [Bitmap](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_BitmapExtensions.htm), [Image](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_ImageExtensions.htm), [Metafile](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_MetafileExtensions.htm) and [Graphics](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_GraphicsExtensions.htm) types.

> 💡 _Tip_:
> * Feel free to explore the [application examples](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/tree/master/Examples) to see how to use KGy SOFT Drawing Libraries in various environments such as [MAUI](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/tree/master/Examples/Maui), [UWP](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/tree/master/Examples/Uwp), [WinForms](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/tree/master/Examples/WinForms), [WinUI](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/tree/master/Examples/WinUI), [WPF](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/tree/master/Examples/Wpf) and [Xamarin](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/tree/master/Examples/Xamarin).
> * For technology-agnostic solutions that can be used on any platform see the [KGySoft.Drawing.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Core/) package.
> * For WPF specific solutions see the [KGySoft.Drawing.Wpf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Wpf/) package. It makes possible to obtain a managed, fast accessible bitmap data for a `WriteableBitmap` instance of any pixel format, offering all features of an [`IReadWriteBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IReadWriteBitmapData.htm) for a `WriteableBitmap`.
> * For dedicated UWP support see the [KGySoft.Drawing.Uwp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Uwp/) package.
> * For dedicated WinUI support see the [KGySoft.Drawing.WinUI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.WinUI/) package.
> * For SkiaSharp specific solutions see the [KGySoft.Drawing.SkiaSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.SkiaSharp/) package. It makes possible to obtain managed, fast accessible bitmap data for `SKBitmap` and `SKPixmap` instances of any pixel format, offering all [`IReadWriteBitmapData`](https://docs.kgysoft.net/drawing/html/T_KGySoft_Drawing_Imaging_IReadWriteBitmapData.htm) features for them. It also offers extension methods for the `SKImage`, `SKSurface`, `SKBitmap`, `SKPixmap` and `SKImageInfo` classes.
> * See also the [KGySoft.Drawing.Tools](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing.Tools) repository, which contains debugger visualizers built on the KGy SOFT Drawing Libraries as well as a test project, which demonstrates its features.
