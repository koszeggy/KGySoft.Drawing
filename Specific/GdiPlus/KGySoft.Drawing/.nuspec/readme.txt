Thank you for installing KGy SOFT Drawing Libraries 7.0.0-preview.2
KGy SOFT Drawing Libraries offer advanced drawing features for System.Drawing types.

⚠️ Warning: Version 7.0.0 introduces several breaking changes. Most importantly, the technology-agnostic and
   platform independent APIs have been extracted into a separated package: KGySoft.Drawing.Core.
   Please find the KGySoft.Drawing.Core package at https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing.Core/.

Release Notes: https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/Specific/GdiPlus/KGySoft.Drawing/changelog.txt

📝 Note: In .NET 7 and above this package can be used on Windows only. When targeting earlier versions, Unix/Linux
         based systems are also supported (if the libgdiplus library is installed).
