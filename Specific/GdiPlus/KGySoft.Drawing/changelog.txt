  See also https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/KGySoft.Drawing.Core/changelog.txt

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace
===========================
! GraphicsPathExtensions class:
  ! ToGraphicsPath method:
    ! Instead of returning a path with flattened points, now it preserves the original curves as much as possible.
    - Single-point segments are now preserved even if they are the only segment in a figure.
- IconExtensions class:
  - ExtractBitmap(Icon,int,bool) method: It could return null for non-zero indices, even if the icon contained more
    than one icons.
- ImageExtensions class:
  - EqualsByContent method: Fixing a possible GDI+ exception when one of the images is disposed.
    From now on, if either of the images is disposed, the result is always false.

+ KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace
===================================
+ New ReadWriteBitmapDataExtensions class:
  + New [Begin]DrawText[Async]/EndDrawText methods: To draw a text using a GDI+ Font and StringFormat into an
    IReadWriteBitmapData instance.

    and StringFormat into an IReadWriteBitmapData instance.


~~~~~~~~~
! v9.2.0:
~~~~~~~~~

- Common changes

  See also https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/KGySoft.Drawing.Core/changelog.txt

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace
===========================
! Icons class:
  ! SystemInformation/SystemQuestion/SystemWarning/SystemError/SystemApplication properties: Up to now the returned
    icons contained exactly two images, whose sizes depended on the DPI of the primary display. From now on the
    returned icons contain all images the icons actually have. To get an icon exactly with a specific size, you can
    use the new Resize extension method.
  ! FromFile(string) method:
    ! From now on it throws an exception if the file does not exist.
    ! The returned icons contain not just up to two images but all images the icon resources actually have.
  + New FromFile(string, int) overload to retrieve an icon of the specified integer identifier from a file.
  + New SystemSecuritySuccess/SystemSecurityQuestion/SystemSecurityWarning/SystemSecurityError properties: As the
    OS-dependent counterpart of the Security* properties, their images depend on the current Windows version.

+ IconExtensions class:
  + New Resize methods to extract exactly a specific icon size from an icon resource. If no such image is available,
    the next larger or smaller image is scaled to the requested size.


~~~~~~~~~
* v9.1.0:
~~~~~~~~~

* Common changes
================
* Referencing KGySoft.Drawing.Core v9.1.0, which contains minor bug fixes.
  See also https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/KGySoft.Drawing.Core/changelog.txt

+ KGySoft.Drawing namespace
===========================
+ New GraphicsPathExtensions class: (meant to be added to v9.0.0 but it was internal until now)
  + New AddRoundRectangle methods - just exposing the old private implementation for GraphicsPath with the improved
    corner radius handling introduced in v9.0.0.
  + New ToPath method
  + New ToGraphicsPath method


~~~~~~~~~
! v9.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly changes:
===================
! Dropping support for .NET Core 2.0. Manual compilation for .NET Core 2.0 is still possible but the public NuGet
  packages are not going to support this platform anymore. If you target the .NET Core 2.0 platform in your project,
  the v9.0.0 version of the NuGet package will pick the .NET Standard 2.0 build instead.

* Common changes
================
* Referencing KGySoft.Drawing.Core v9.0.0, which enables high performance shape drawing. Combined with this package
  it makes possible to draw shapes into Bitmap instances of any pixel format, even indexed ones.
  See also https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/KGySoft.Drawing.Core/changelog.txt
  and also https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/README.md#shape-drawing

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace
===========================
! GraphicsExtensions class:
  ! DrawRoundRectangle/FillRoundRectangle methods:
    ! When the corner radius/radii was/were negative or too large, the result was incorrect. From now on always the
      absolute value of the corner radius parameters is used, and if they are too large, they are automatically
      adjusted to the maximum possible value. Though this is actually a fix, it's indicated as a breaking change
      because the result will be different for invalid corner radius values.
    + New overloads with floating-point parameters.


~~~~~~~~~
! v8.1.0:
~~~~~~~~~

* Common changes
================
* Referencing KGySoft.Drawing.Core v8.1.0, which improves performance, especially regarding Palette operations,
  optimized quantizers and vector operations.
  See also https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/KGySoft.Drawing.Core/changelog.txt

! KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace
===================================
! ReadableBitmapDataExtensions class:
  ! ToBitmap, BeginToBitmap, ToBitmapAsync methods:
    ! When target pixel format is not specified, these method no longer return a Bitmap with Format16bppGrayScale
      pixel format because it is basically supported by this library only but not by the native GDI+ operations.
      Instead, a Bitmap with Format8bppIndexed format with a gray-scale palette is returned, even though it may end
      up in loss of information. If you need the original behavior you still can specify the pixel format.
    - When the target pixel format is an indexed one but there is no target palette specified and the source also
      has no palette, then the back color, alpha threshold and working color space of the source are now respected.


~~~~~~~~~
! v8.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

+ Assembly changes:
===================
+ Targeting also .NET Framework 4.6 and .NET Standard 2.1

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace
===========================

  ! GetInfo method: For pixel formats with linear gamma the Prefers128BitColors property is now set in the result.
  + ToPixelFormat method: Supporting the new KnownPixelFormat values of v8.0.0
* BitmapExtensions class:
  * GetReadableBitmapData/GetWritableBitmapData/GetReadWriteBitmapData methods:
    + They support getting/setting pixels using wide colors without quantizing the color information to the 32-bit
      ARGB color space.
    - Fixing possible errors when the backing buffer of the 48/64 bpp pixel formats contains invalid values.


~~~~~~~~~
* v7.2.0:
~~~~~~~~~

* Common changes
================
* Performance improvements, especially for wide pixel formats.
  See also https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/KGySoft.Drawing.Core/changelog.txt

- KGySoft.Drawing namespace
===========================
- ImageExtensions class:
  - SaveAsIcon: Fixing alpha values when the source image has 32bpp PARGB pixel format.
- PixelFormatExtensions class:
  - GetMatchingQuantizer method: The WorkingColorSpace of the returned quantizer is set to Linear if source pixel
    format uses the linear color space.


~~~~~~~~~
! v7.1.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! Common changes
================
! From now on alpha blending operations on Bitmap instances (eg. DrawInto extensions) are performed in the linear
  color space for 48/64 bpp pixel formats on Windows. To use a specific color space regardless of the pixel format
  obtain a managed bitmap data by the new GetReadableBitmapData/GetWritableBitmapData/GetReadWriteBitmapData
  extension method overloads with WorkingColorSpace parameters and use the platform independent extension methods
  (eg. BitmapDataExtensions from the KGySoft.Drawing.Core package) instead.

+ KGySoft.Drawing namespace
===========================
+ BitmapExtensions class:
  + New GetReadableBitmapData overload with WorkingColorSpace parameter.

  See also https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing/blob/master/KGySoft.Drawing.Core/changelog.txt
! Targeting also .NET 7. Indicated as a breaking change because if a consumer project also targets .NET 7 or newer,
  then this library can be used only on Windows. When targeting .NET 6 or earlier platforms, Unix/Linux is still
  supported if libgdiplus is installed. Platform-independent API is now in the KGySoft.Drawing.Core library.

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace
===========================
! Some types have been moved to the KGySoft.Drawing.Core package (with unchanged namespace).
! The IDrawingProgress interface has been removed. It is replaced by KGySoft.Threading.IAsyncProgress from the

- KGySoft.Drawing namespace:
============================
- MetafileExtensions class:
  - ToBitmap method: Fixing result in Windows if keeping aspect ratio without anti-aliasing and metafile origin is
    not at Point.Zero location (a metafile can be located even at negative coordinates). On Linux/Mono the result
    still can be misplaced though.
- Icons/IconExtensions classes: Tolerating if BMP icon stream does not have a transparency mask.


~~~~~~~~~
! v5.2.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace:
============================
! PixelFormatExtensions:
  ! The IsSupported method has been renamed to IsSupportedNatively because BitmapDataFactory can create a managed
    bitmap data of any pixel formats.
! ImageExtensions class:

  - Clear methods: Fixing result with ditherers that rely on actual content
  - TransformColors methods: Fixing result with ditherers that rely on actual content
! GraphicsExtensions class:
  ! ToBitmap method:
    ! If the Graphics belongs to a Bitmap, and there is any clipping on Graphics, then the result Bitmap preserves
      original PixelFormat instead of always returning a Format32bppArgb Bitmap.

* Referencing KGySoft.CoreLibraries 5.1.1

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace:
============================
! BitmapExtensions class
  ! The GetColorCount method does not transform pixels of wide color formats to 32-bit colors anymore so it may
    return a different result (an accurate one) for Bitmaps with 16-bit grayscale, 48-bit and 64-bit PixelFormats.
  - Clear method: fixing direct clearing (when no ditherer is used) for bitmaps with negative stride.
! Icons class:
  ! Combine methods:
    ! Icons larger than 64x64 were saved as compressed by default. Now compressing icons with size at least 256x256
      for better compatibility with some applications/platforms.
    ! Icon images with lower than 32 bits-per-pixel are not compressed anymore. Even Windows has problems with 24
      BPP compressed icons and transparency mask for lower BPPs can be generated only for uncompressed images.
    + Adding new overloads with IEnumerable<Icon> and IEnumerable<Bitmap> parameters.
! IconExtensions class:
  ! SaveHighQuality method has been renamed to SaveAsIcon to match with its ImageExtensions counterpart.
  ! ToMultiResBitmap methods: They don't return compressed results on any platforms anymore because PNG compressed
    sub-images could cause problems even on Windows systems. The overload with the forceUncompressedResult parameter
    is now obsolete.

  + New GetIconInfo methods
  - Improving appearance of 32bpp icons on Windows XP when saving uncompressed.
  - ExtractIcon and ExtractBitmap overloads: Requested icon size did not work for larger than 256x256 icon sizes or
    PNG compressed icons smaller than 256x256 pixels.
  - ExtractIcon: It could return null if the requested icon was not supported (just like ExtractNearestIcon) though
    according to the documentation this method should throw PlatformNotSupportedExteption in such cases.
+ New IconInfo type
+ The PixelFormatExtensions class has been made public along with some methods:
  + ToBitsPerPixel
  + IsIndexed
  + IsValidFormat
  + IsSupported
- ImageExtensions class:
  - Fixing SaveAsTiff if currentFrameOnly = false and image contains non-icon images.

* KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace:
====================================
+ IBitmapData interface: New RowSize property
- IReadableBitmapDataRow.ReadRaw<T> and IWritableBitmapDataRow.WriteRaw<T> methods: The range check of the internal

! v5.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly changes:
===================
! Referencing KGySoft.CoreLibraries 5.0.1
+ Targeting also .NET Core 2.0.
+ Targeting also .NET Core 3.0.

+ KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace:
====================================
A New namespace for fast and direct Bitmap pixel manipulation in a type-safe and managed way.
Additionally, provides types for quantizing and dithering.
The new public types in this namespace:
+ IBitmapData interface
+ IReadableBitmapData interface
+ IWritableBitmapData interface
+ IReadWriteBitmapData interface
+ IBitmapDataRow interface
+ IReadableBitmapDataRow interface
+ IWritableBitmapDataRow interface
+ IReadWriteBitmapDataRow interface
+ IDitherer interface
+ IDitheringSession interface
+ IQuantizer interface
+ IQuantizingSession interface
+ PredefinedColorsQuantizer class
+ OptimizedPaletteQuantizer class
+ OrderedDitherer class
+ ErrorDiffusionDitherer class
+ InterleavedGradientNoiseDitherer class
+ RandomNoiseDitherer class
+ Palette class
+ Color32 structure

- KGySoft.Drawing namespace:
============================
+ BitmapExtensions class:
  - Resize method:
    - Fixing resize if keepAspectRatio is true
    - Supporting every source pixel format
    * keepAspectRation parameter is now optional (default value: false)
  + New GetReadableBitmapData/GetWritableBitmapData/GetReadWriteBitmapData methods: They provide and fast managed
    pixel access and/or manipulation for any pixel formats.
  + New Quantize method: Reduces number of colors
  + New Dither method: Reduces number of colors with dithering
  + New Clear methods: Similar to Graphics.Clear but supports every PixelFormat
  + New GetColorCount method
  + New TransformColors method
  + New ReplaceColor method
  + New Inverse method
  + New MakeOpaque method
  + New MakeGrayscale method
  + New AdjustBrightness method
  + New AdjustContrast method
  + New AdjustGamma method
- IconExtensions class:
  - ExtractBitmap/ExtractBitmaps:
    - Fixing ArgumentNullException if the icon was created from a handle and keepOriginalFormat parameter was true.
    - Returning null instances on Linux for unsupported icon sizes instead of throwing an exception.
  - ExtractNearestBitmap method: On Linux if large icon size is not supported returning the next largest icon
    instead of throwing an exception.
  - Combine methods:
    - Have been fixed for indexed bitmaps with specified transparent color
    - If a Bitmap instance contain multiple icons all of them are added
+ ImageExtensions class:
  + ConvertPixelFormat method:
    + Supporting every pixel formats, including Format16bppGrayScale and Format16bppArgb1555.
    + New backColor optional parameter: Specifies a background color for non-alpha pixel formats. From now on
      converting alpha bitmaps to non-alpha ones the color of the originally alpha pixels will not be necessarily
      black. Not fully transparent pixels are blended with the specified background color.
    + New alphaThreshold optional parameter: If the new pixel format has one bit alpha or is indexed, then specifies
      a threshold value for treating alpha pixels completely transparent. Alpha pixels, which are not treated
      transparent are blended with the backColor parameter.
    + New overloads for omitting palette and for using a custom quantizer and ditherer.
  * ToGrayscale method: Now supports every source pixel format.
  - EqualsByContent method:
    - Images with different raw format were considered different even if their raw content were the same. From now
      on images with different raw format can also be considered equal (as expected based on the documentation).
    - Images with the same stride size were considered different if the absolute value of their stride were
      different (a top-down image was compared to a bottom-up image).
  + New DrawInto methods: Similar to Graphics.DrawImage but supports every PixelFormat
  ! The old SaveAsGif overloads are marked Obsolete. They are improved though and use the new quantizers/ditherers
    rather than relying on the dithering of the built-in GIF encoder.
  - SaveAsMultipageTiff method: Handling of some PixelFormats have been fixed.
  + New ToIcon overload: allows to convert non-squared images to icons, the result may have more images.
  + New SaveAsBmp method
  + New SaveAsGif overload with custom quantizer and ditherer
  + New SaveAsIcon methods
  + New SaveAsJpeg method
  + New SaveAsPng method
  + New SaveAsTiff method
- MetafileExtensions class:
  - Save method: Fixing an ArgumentException if the raw format of the metafile to save is WMF rather than EMF.

~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly: Referencing KGySoft.CoreLibraries v4.7.0

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace:
============================
! IconExtensions class:
  ! ExtractNearestBitmap/ExtractNearestIcon methods: Size has preference over BPP value and on equal distances
    the larger size and higher BPP values are selected. In contrast, in previous versions the result could
    depend on the order of the stored images.
  + New ToUncompressedIcon method.
  + New IsCompressed method.
  + New GetBitsPerPixel method.
  * ToMultiResBitmap method:
    + A new overload that can be used to prevent compression for larger images in the result bitmap.
    - The original overload prevents compression in Windows XP and allows it in Windows Vista and above.
  * ExtractIcons, ExtractIcon, ExtractNearestIcon, Combine methods:
    + New overloads that can be used to prevent compression if the result icon contains larger images.
    - The original overloads prevent compression in Windows XP and allows it in Windows Vista and above.
  + SaveHighQuality method: New forceUncompressedResult optional parameter.

! ImageExtensions class:
  ! ConvertPixelFormat method:
    ! The return type has been changed to Bitmap from Image
    * The palette parameter is now optional.

* Icons class:
  + New FromStream methods.
  - Information, Warning, Question, Error, Shield, Application,
    SecurityShield, SecuritySuccess, SecurityWarning, SecurityQuestion, SecurityError properties:
    If obtained in Windows XP, the resulting icon does not contain compressed images.
  * Combine methods:
    + New overloads that can be used to prevent compression if the result icon contains larger images.
    - The original overloads prevent compression in Windows XP and allows it in Windows Vista and above.
  + Application property: 64x64 image has been added.
  + Information property: 64x64, 24x24 and 20x20 images have been added.
  + Warning property: 64x64, 24x24 and 20x20 images have been added.
  + Error property: 64x64 and 20x20 images have been added.
  + Question property: 64x64 image has been replaced, 24x24 and 20x20 images have been added.

* v4.6.1:
~~~~~~~~~

* KGySoft.Drawing namespace:
============================
* IconExtensions class:
  - ToMultiResBitmap: Fixing InvalidOperationException
  - ExtractBitmap and ExtractIcon overloads: Not creating unnecessary Bitmap/Icon instances, which would be discarded anyway.


~~~~~~~~~
! v4.6.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly: Applying SecurityRuleSet.Level2 and adjusting security critical calls in the whole assembly.
  This is a breaking change for .NET4.0 and above only if the caller assembly is partially trusted or is
  security transparent and tries to call the few of the public methods, which are security critical.
* Moving the repository to GitHub
! Referencing KGySoft.CoreLibraries 4.6.0 and using its public resources for general messages.
+ Dynamic localizable resources are applied for KGySoft.Drawing

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace:
============================
! Removing the Images class along with the related resources
+ Moving public SaveAsGif methods to KGySoft.Drawing from VisualizerHelpers
