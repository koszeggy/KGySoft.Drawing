===============================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~
! v10.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~~

! KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace
===================================
! BitmapDataExtensions class:
  ! [Begin]AdjustBrightness[Async]/[Begin]AdjustContrast[Async]/[Begin]AdjustGamma[Async]/[Begin]Invert[Async]/
    [Begin]MakeGrayscale[Async]/[Begin]MakeOpaque[Async]/[Begin]MakeTransparent[Async]/[Begin]ReplaceColor[Async]
    methods:
    ! Working in linear color space if the working color space of the source bitmap is linear or the pixel format
      has linear gamma. Previously these methods always worked in sRGB color space.
    + Preserving the original color depth for wide pixel formats. Previously the colors were quantized to 32 bit
      during the operation even without a specified quantizer.
  ! [Begin]ToGrayscale[Async]/[Begin]ToTransparent[Async] methods:
    ! The pixel format of the result is no longer always Format32bppArgb. If the source bitmap has a wide format,
      then the result preserves the original color depth. But the result may now preserve even indexed formats.
  ! EndTransformColors/EndAdjustBrightness/EndAdjustContrast/EndAdjustGamma/EndClear/EndCopyTo/EndDither
    /EndDrawInto/EndInvert/EndMakeGrayscale/EndMakeOpaque/EndMakeTransparent/EndQuantize/EndReplaceColor methods:
    The return type has been changed to bool from void.
  * TransformColorsAsync/AdjustBrightnessAsync/AdjustContrastAsync/ClearAsync/CopyToAsync/DitherAsync/DrawIntoAsync/
    InvertAsync/MakeGrayscaleAsync/MakeOpaqueAsync/MakeTransparentAsync/QuantizeAsync/ReplaceColorAsync methods:
    The return type has been changed to Task<bool> from Task.
  + New Combine/BeginCombine/EndCombine/CombineAsync methods to combine two bitmaps using a specified function.
  + New TransformColors/BeginTransformColors/TransformColorsAsync overloads with callbacks using Color64/ColorF
    types to support wide pixel formats.
  + New AdjustBrightness/AdjustContrast/AdjustGamma/Invert/MakeGrayscale/MakeOpaque/MakeTransparent/ReplaceColor/
    Resize/ToGrayscale/ToTransparent overloads with ParallelConfig and IAsyncContext parameters.
* ColorExtensions class:
  + New ToGray overloads with WorkingColorSpace parameter.
  - Fixing GetBrightness(Color64, WorkingColorSpace) method for the linear color space.


~~~~~~~~~
- v9.1.1:
~~~~~~~~~

- KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace
===================================
- PredefinedColorsQuantizer class:
  - FromCustomFuction(Func<Color32, Color32>, KnownPixelFormat) method: Contrary to the documentation, the
    quantizing function was only called with non-alpha colors, after blending with black background. This bug
    appeared in v9.0.0. The fix affects also some other methods, e.g. FromBitmapData or ToGrayscale.


~~~~~~~~~
- v9.1.0:
~~~~~~~~~

- KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace
===================================
- BitmapDataExtensions class:
  - Some End* methods of the Async APM (old Begin/End pattern) methods that rely on the TransformColors
    implementation could throw an InvalidOperationException in v9.0.0.


~~~~~~~~~
! v9.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly changes:
===================
! Dropping support for .NET Core 2.0. Manual compilation for .NET Core 2.0 is still possible but the public NuGet
  packages are not going to support this platform anymore. If you target the .NET Core 2.0 platform in your project,
  the v9.0.0 version of the NuGet package will pick the .NET Standard 2.0 build instead.

! General changes:
===================
! All methods with a ParallelConfig/AsyncConfig/TaskConfig parameter (breaking only on Windows .NET 5.0 and below):
  ! When AsyncConfigBase.MaxDegreeOfParallelism is zero or less, then the maximum degree of parallelism was
    determined by Environment.ProcessorCount, which doesn't respect the CPU affinity for the current process if the
    targeted platform is below .NET 6.0. From now on the CPU affinity is respected on all platform targets.

! KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace
===================================
! IReadableBitmapData interface: (breaking only if you implement it, which is normally not needed)
  ! New GetColorIndex/ReadRaw<T> methods
! IWritableBitmapData interface: (breaking only if you implement it, which is normally not needed)
  ! New SetColorIndex/WriteRaw<T> methods
! BitmapDataFactory class:
  ! CreateBitmapData overloads with T[], ArraySection<T> or Array2D<T> buffer and KnownPixelFormat parameters:
    ! The stride must be a multiple of the pixel size of the specified pixel format as well, not just the element
      size of the underlying array type. Unmanaged buffers, buffers of T[,], and custom pixel formats are not
      affected by this new constraint.
  * Self-allocating CreateBitmapData overloads: By default, no longer using array pooling if the natural element
    type of the underlying array is other than byte. This can be adjusted by the new PoolingStrategy property.
  + New PoolingStrategy property
- BitmapDataExtensions class:
  - Cloning a bitmap with a custom pixel format may have failed if the source bitmap was so huge that the cloned
    bitmap could not be created with a byte array buffer. If the bitmap is too big even for an UInt64 array buffer,
    then a NotSupportedException is thrown.
+ Palette class:
  + Now every factory method has an overload that allows specifying the alpha threshold, not just the ones that
    return a palette with alpha colors.
* PredefinedColorsQuantizer class:
  + New FromCustomPalette overload that allows specifying the palette entries as Color32 values.
  * Every method with Color parameter now has an overload with Color32 parameter. The old overloads are now hidden,
    though they are still there for binary compatibility.
  + Alpha threshold can be specified for all quantizers, not just for the ones that have alpha colors.
+ New ArrayPoolingStrategy enumeration

* Palette class:
  * GetNearestColor and GetNearestColorIndex methods:
    * Improving performance
    - AlphaThreshold was not considered for partially transparent colors with an exact match in the palette.
    - The result was not always correct if the palette contained partially transparent colors.


~~~~~~~~~
! v8.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

+ Assembly changes:
===================
+ Targeting also .NET 8.0

! KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace
===================================
! BitmapDataFactory class:
  ! The old CreateBitmapData overloads for custom pixel formats (the ones that have PixelFormatInfo parameter) no
    longer assume that the delegates can work independently with any back buffer. To assume this use the new
    overloads with Custom[Indexed]BitmapDataConfig parameters and set the BackBufferIndependentPixelAccess property.
  + New CreateBitmapData overloads with Custom[Indexed]BitmapDataConfig parameters for custom pixel format with
    delegates for also other color types than Color32. You can use these for wide custom pixel formats.
! BitmapDataExtensions class:
  ! GetColorCount/BeginGetColorCount/ColorCountAsync methods: For custom pixel formats or when the raw data was not
    accessible the counting quantized the possibly wide colors to 32 bit. From now on the real number of colors are
    returned even for such cases. Though it counts as a breaking change, this is actually an improvement.
  ! Clone/BeginClone/CloneAsync methods: When the target pixel format was a different wide format than that of the
    source, then the colors were quantized to 32 bit during the operation even without a specified quantizer.
    From now on the cloning can preserve the original color depth between different wide formats. Marked as a
    breaking change but this is actually an improvement.
  ! CopyTo/BeginCopyTo/CopyToAsync methods: When the target pixel format was a different wide format than that of
    the source, then the colors were quantized to 32 bit during the operation even without a specified quantizer.
    From now on the copying can preserve the original color depth between different wide formats. Marked as a
    breaking change but this is actually an improvement.
  ! DrawInto/BeginDrawInto/DrawIntoAsync methods: When the target pixel format was a different wide format than that
    of the source, then the colors were quantized to 32 bit during the operation even without a specified quantizer.
    From now on the drawing can preserve the original color depth between different wide formats. Marked as a
    breaking change but this is actually an improvement.
! PixelFormatInfo struct:
  ! ToKnownPixelFormat method: It can return the new KnownPixelFormat values.
  + New Prefers64BitColors and Prefers128BitColors properties
  - LinearGamma property: setting it to false did not reset the value.
! PredefinedColorsQuantizer class:
  ! FromBitmapData and FromPalette methods: The PixelFormatHint property of the returned quantizer can return one
    of the new pixel formats.
! IWritableBitmapData interface: (breaking only if you implement it, which is normally not needed)
  ! SetColor32 method: it no longer has default implementation (.NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard 2.1 and above)
  ! New SetColor64/SetColorF/SetPColor32/SetPColor64/SetPColorF methods
! IReadableBitmapData interface: (breaking only if you implement it, which is normally not needed)

! IReadableBitmapDataRow interface: (breaking only if you implement it, which is normally not needed)
  ! New GetColor32/GetColor64/GetColorF/GetPColor32/GetPColor64/GetPColorF methods
+ KnownPixelFormat enum:
  + New Format96bppRgb field
  + New Format128bppRgba field
  + New Format128bppPRgba field
  + New Format8bppGrayScale field
  + New Format32bppGrayScale field
+ New CustomBitmapDataConfig, CustomIndexedBitmapDataConfig types for configuring pixel access of bitmaps with
  custom pixel formats.
* ColorExtensions class:
  + New ToColor* overloads between sRGB and linear color formats with adjustColorSpace parameter.
  - Fixing Blend(ColorF, ColorF, WorkingColorSpace) method for the sRGB color space.
+ PColor32 struct:
  + New FromArgb overload
+ PColor64 struct:
  + New FromArgb overload
+ ColorF struct:
  + New FromArgb method
  + New FromGray method
  + New ToGray method
  + New ToOpaque method
+ PColorF struct:
  + New FromArgb method


~~~~~~~~~
* v7.2.0:
~~~~~~~~~

* KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace
===================================
+ The Color64 struct has been made public
+ The ColorF struct has been made public
+ New PColor32 struct
+ New PColor64 struct
+ New PColorF struct
+ Color32 struct:
  + New ToArgbUInt32/ToRgbUInt32 methods
  + New FromArgb/FromRgb overload from uint
* ColorExtensions class:
  + New ToColor/ToColor32/ToColor64/ToColorF/ToPColor32/ToPColor64/ToPColorF methods
  + New ToPremultiplied/ToStraight methods
  + New GetBrightness overloads
  + New GetBrightnessF methods
  + New Blend overloads
  + New TolerantEquals overloads
  * Improving performance (Blend, GetBrightness and some internal conversion operations)
* ColorSpaceHelper class:
  + Adding new ToFloat overload from UInt16
  + Adding new ToUInt16 methods
  + Adding new SrgbToLinear overload from UInt16
  + Adding new LinearToSrgb16Bit method
  + Adding new ToByte overload from UInt16
  - Fixing float-float version of LinearToSrgb for some out-of-bounds values
* Palette class:
  * Grayscale256 method: improving grayscale mapping when working in the linear color space
  + Grayscale16/Grayscale4 methods: special linear color space handling even if directMapping is true
+ PredefinedColorsQuantizer class:
  + New FromCustomFunction overload
* BitmapDataFactory class:
  * Improving grayscale conversion for the known grayscale pixel format when working in the linear color space
- BitmapDataExtensions class:
  - Some Clone overloads did not preserve original back color and alpha threshold.
- PixelFormatInfo struct:
  - Setting HasAlpha to false did not reset also the HasPremultipliedAlpha and HasSingleBitAlpha properties, though
    setting these properties to true did set also the HasAlpha property.


~~~~~~~~~
! v7.1.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace
===================================
! IBitmapData interface:
  ! New WorkingColorSpace property. Not a breaking change when targeting at least .NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard 2.1
    where this property has a default implementation and returns WorkingColorSpace.Default.
! IQuantizingSession interface:
  ! New WorkingColorSpace property. Not a breaking change when targeting at least .NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard
    2.1 where this property has a default implementation and returns WorkingColorSpace.Default.
! Palette class:
  ! The constructors with Func<Color32, int> parameters are now obsolete. These overloads have no default parameters
    anymore so if you didn't use the old customGetNearestColorIndex parameter, then automatically the new overloads
    are called if you recompile your code.
  + New constructor overloads with IEnumerable<Color32> parameter instead of an array.
  + New constructor and factory method overloads with workingColorSpace parameters.
  + New WorkingColorSpace property.
  - The constructor with Color32[] parameter just used to store the specified array. This made possible to corrupt
    the palette if the array elements were changed after creating the palette. From now on the elements are copied
    into a new storage.
! RandomNoiseDitherer:
  ! New constructor overload. Marked as a breaking change because if an integer constant literal was passed to the
    strength parameter the compiler may say the call is ambiguous between float and AutoStrengthMode enum.
! InterleavedGradientNoiseDitherer:
  ! New constructor overload. Marked as a breaking change because if an integer constant literal was passed to the
    strength parameter the compiler may say the call is ambiguous between float and AutoStrengthMode enum.
+ New IPalette interface
+ New WorkingColorSpace enumeration
+ New AutoStrengthMode enumeration
+ BitmapDataExtensions class:
  + New Clone/BeginClone/CloneAsync overloads with workingColorSpace parameter.
  + New GetPreferredColorSpace method.
+ BitmapDataFactory class:
  + New CreateBitmapData overloads with workingColorSpace parameter.
+ ColorExtensions class:
  + New Blend overload
+ New ColorSpaceHelper class
+ PredefinedColorsQuantizer class:
  + New WorkingColorSpace property.
  + New ConfigureColorSpace method
+ OptimizedPaletteQuantizer class:
  + New WorkingColorSpace property.
  + New ConfigureColorSpace method
+ PixelFormatInfo struct:
  + New LinearGamma property.


~~~~~~~~~
! v7.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: This is the first version of KGySoft.Drawing.Core but as it was extracted from the KGySoft.Drawing library the
changes are compared to KGySoft.Drawing v6.3.2. Breaking changes can be interpreted as an upgrade from that library.

! Assembly changes:
===================
! System.Drawing.Common package is no longer referenced (.NET Core/Standard 2.0 and above). To use APIs that depend
  on System.Drawing.Common (eg. Image, Bitmap, Icon, Metafile, etc.) reference the KGySoft.Drawing package.

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace
===========================
! The IDrawingProgress interface has been removed. It is replaced by KGySoft.Threading.IAsyncProgress from the
  KGySoft.CoreLibraries assembly.
! The DrawingProgress struct has been removed. It is replaced by KGySoft.Threading.AsyncProgress<T> from the
  KGySoft.CoreLibraries assembly.
! The AsyncConfigBase, AsyncConfig and TaskConfig classes and the IAsyncContext interface have been replaced by the
  identically named types from the KGySoft.Threading namespace in the KGySoft.CoreLibraries assembly.

! KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace
===================================
! Every method with a System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat enum parameter have been changed to use the
  KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging.KnownPixelFormat enum type instead. The field names of both enums are the same.
! IBitmapData interface:
  ! The PixelFormat property from now on returns a PixelFormatInfo struct rather than an enum value of the
    System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat type. It now supports custom formats better and you still can convert it
    to a known format if needed.
  ! New Size property. Not a breaking change when targeting at least .NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard 2.1 where
    this property has a default implementation using the Width and Height properties.
! IBitmapDataRow interface:
  ! The MoveNextRow method has been moved to the new IBitmapDataRowMovable interface
! ICustomBitmapDataRow interface
  ! New Index property
! IReadableBitmapData interface
  ! FirstRow returns an IReadableBitmapDataRowMovable instead of IReadableBitmapDataRow
  ! New GetMovableRow method. Not a breaking change when targeting at least .NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard 2.1 where
    this method has a default implementation.
  ! New GetColor32 method. Not a breaking change when targeting at least .NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard 2.1 where
    this method has a default implementation.
! IWritableBitmapData interface
  ! FirstRow returns an IWritableBitmapDataRowMovable instead of IWritableBitmapDataRow
  ! New GetMovableRow method. Not a breaking change when targeting at least .NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard 2.1 where
    this method has a default implementation.
  ! New SetColor32 method. Not a breaking change when targeting at least .NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard 2.1 where
    this method has a default implementation.
! IReadWriteBitmapData interface
  ! FirstRow returns an IReadWriteBitmapDataRowMovable instead of IReadWriteBitmapDataRow
  ! New GetMovableRow method. Not a breaking change when targeting at least .NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard 2.1 where
    this method has a default implementation.
! BitmapDataExtensions class:
  ! The ToBitmap/BeginToBitmap/EndToBitmap/ToBitmapAsync methods are now in the ReadableBitmapDataExtensions class
    of the KGySoft.Drawing package. When recompiling C# sources, this is not a breaking change if you use the
    KGySoft.Drawing package and use these methods as extensions (without the class name).
  + New Clone/CopyTo/DrawInto/Clear/TransformColors/Quantize/Dither overloads with IAsyncContext parameter.
  + New Resize/BeginResize/EndResize/ResizeAsync methods
! IQuantizingSession interface:
  ! New IsGrayscale property. Not a breaking change when targeting at least .NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard 2.1 where
    this property returns false if not implemented.
+ ColorExtensions class:
  + New Color32 extension method.
  * Blend method: improving performance when blending with opaque background color.
+ New KnownPixelFormat enum. The names of the actual formats are compatible with System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat
  but some of them have different underlying values. Use the ToPixelFormat extension from KGySoft.Drawing to convert
  it to a System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.
+ New IBitmapDataRowMovable, IReadableBitmapDataRowMovable, IWritableBitmapDataRowMovable and
  IReadWriteBitmapDataRowMovable interfaces
+ New KnownPixelFormatExtensions class
+ Palette class:
  + New public constructor to create a new Palette from an existing one with different back color and alpha
    threshold values.
  + The IsGrayscale and HasAlpha properties have been made public.
+ PixelFormatInfo struct:
  + New public constructor from KnownPixelFormat
  + New IsCustomFormat property
  + Implementing IEquatable<PixelFormatInfo>
  + Equality and inequality operators are overloaded
  + New ToKnownPixelFormat method
+ New QuantizerExtensions class to initialize a quantizing session asynchronously (.NET Framework 4.0 and above)
+ New DithererExtensions class to initialize a dithering session asynchronously (.NET Framework 4.0 and above)
+ Color32 struct:
  + Making Color32 serializable
  + New implicit conversions to and from Color.
+ PredefinedColorsQuantizer class:
  + New public BackColor, AlphaThreshold and Palette properties.
+ OptimizedPaletteQuantizer class:
  + New BackColor, AlphaThreshold and MaxColors properties.
