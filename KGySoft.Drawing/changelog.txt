===============================================================================

~~~~~~~~~
* v6.2.0:
~~~~~~~~~

* Assembly changes:
===================
+ Explicitly targeting also .NET Framework 4.6.

~~~~~~~~~

- Common changes:
=================
- Using unified entry points on Windows for P/Invoke calls both for .NET Framework and .NET/Core platforms. This
  helps to avoid issues when a .NET Framework build is executed on .NET/Core (should not occur when using package
  references but may happen when developing VisualStudio extensions).

============================
+ ImageExtensions class:
  + New SaveAsHighColorGif methods

! KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace:

  - AddImage method: Improving the compatibility with some decoders by always adding the Graphic Control Extension
    for subsequent frames.
  - Fixing possibly improper clearing regions when AnimatedGifConfiguration.AllowDeltaFrames is true and
    AnimatedGifConfiguration.EncodeTransparentBorders is false.
+ AnimatedGifConfiguration class:
  + New ReportOverallProgress property


~~~~~~~~~
! v6.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly changes:

* Updating KGySoft.CoreLibraries version

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace:
============================
! ImageExtensions class:
  ! The SaveAsGif methods from mow on use the new GifEncoder class. The behavior is functionally equivalent with the
    previous versions but the actual produced stream can be different.
  + New SaveAsAnimatedGif methods
  + New SaveAsMultipageTiff overload
* DrawingModule class: On non-Windows Systems the module initializer enables using System.Drawing types that depend
  on native GDI+ calls.

- BitmapDataExtensions class:
  - Clear/BeginClear/ClearAsync methods: They could throw a NullReferenceException if a custom IWritableBitmapData
    instance had indexed PixelFormat but its Palette was null. From now on even such bitmap data can be cleared but
    the specified color will be ignored and the data is always cleared with zero palette index.
  * AdjustGamma/BeginAdjustGamma/AdjustGammaAsync methods: Improving performance

- KGySoft.Drawing namespace:
============================
- MetafileExtensions class:
  - ToBitmap method: Fixing result in Windows if keeping aspect ratio without anti-aliasing and metafile origin is

~~~~~~~~~
! v5.2.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace:

===================
* Referencing KGySoft.CoreLibraries 5.1.1

! KGySoft.Drawing namespace:
============================
! BitmapExtensions class
  ! The GetColorCount method does not transform pixels of wide color formats to 32-bit colors anymore so it may
    return a different result (an accurate one) for Bitmaps with 16-bit grayscale, 48-bit and 64-bit PixelFormats.
  - Clear method: fixing direct clearing (when no ditherer is used) for bitmaps with negative stride.
! Icons class:
  ! Combine methods:
    ! Icons larger than 64x64 were saved as compressed by default. Now compressing icons with size at least 256x256
      for better compatibility with some applications/platforms.
    ! Icon images with lower than 32 bits-per-pixel are not compressed anymore. Even Windows has problems with 24
      BPP compressed icons and transparency mask for lower BPPs can be generated only for uncompressed images.
    + Adding new overloads with IEnumerable<Icon> and IEnumerable<Bitmap> parameters.
! IconExtensions class:
  ! SaveHighQuality method has been renamed to SaveAsIcon to match with its ImageExtensions counterpart.

    sub-images could cause problems even on Windows systems. The overload with the forceUncompressedResult parameter
    is now obsolete.
  ! Combine methods:
    ! Icons larger than 64x64 were saved as compressed by default. Now compressing icons with size at least 256x256
      for better compatibility with some applications/platforms.

  - ExtractIcon and ExtractBitmap overloads: Requested icon size did not work for larger than 256x256 icon sizes or
    PNG compressed icons smaller than 256x256 pixels.
  - ExtractIcon: It could return null if the requested icon was not supported (just like ExtractNearestIcon) though
    according to the documentation this method should throw PlatformNotSupportedExteption in such cases.
+ New IconInfo type
+ The PixelFormatExtensions class has been made public along with some methods:
  + ToBitsPerPixel
  + IsIndexed
  + IsValidFormat
  + IsSupported
- ImageExtensions class:

    - Fixing resize if keepAspectRatio is true
    - Supporting every source pixel format
    * keepAspectRation parameter is now optional (default value: false)
  + New GetReadableBitmapData/GetWritableBitmapData/GetReadWriteBitmapData methods: They provide and fast managed
    pixel access and/or manipulation for any pixel formats.

    + New backColor optional parameter: Specifies a background color for non-alpha pixel formats. From now on
      converting alpha bitmaps to non-alpha ones the color of the originally alpha pixels will not be necessarily
      black. Not fully transparent pixels are blended with the specified background color.
    + New alphaThreshold optional parameter: If the new pixel format has one bit alpha or is indexed, then specifies
      a threshold value for treating alpha pixels completely transparent. Alpha pixels, which are not treated
      transparent are blended with the backColor parameter.
    + New overloads for omitting palette and for using a custom quantizer and ditherer.
  * ToGrayscale method: Now supports every source pixel format.
  - EqualsByContent method:
    - Images with different raw format were considered different even if their raw content were the same. From now
      on images with different raw format can also be considered equal (as expected based on the documentation).
    - Images with the same stride size were considered different if the absolute value of their stride were
      different (a top-down image was compared to a bottom-up image).
  + New DrawInto methods: Similar to Graphics.DrawImage but supports every PixelFormat
  ! The old SaveAsGif overloads are marked Obsolete. They are improved though and use the new quantizers/ditherers
    rather than relying on the dithering of the built-in GIF encoder.
  - SaveAsMultipageTiff method: Handling of some PixelFormats have been fixed.
  + New ToIcon overload: allows to convert non-squared images to icons, the result may have more images.
